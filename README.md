# Columbia Fintech Bootcamp: Module #10 Challenge

Feature Summary: Crypto Investments

In this challenge, I will assume the role of an advisor in one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world and will propose a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios that are based on cryptocurrencies.  Specifically, I will create a Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods and additionally plot the results so that we can visually show the performance to the board.



- Includes the following tasks:

    * Finding the best value for k (# of clusters) Using the original data provided.
    * Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data
    * Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
    * Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
    * Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
    * Visualize and Compare the Results

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.9 with the following packages:
* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - A powerful data analysis toolkit.
* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Machine learning package.
* [hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/) - high-level API for data exploration and visualization

This project leverages python 3.9 with the following packages:

Jupyter Lab 3.3.2 is required

- *Jupyter Lab is primarily used as a web-based development environment for the notebooks, code, and data associated with this project.  Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science*

## Installation Guide

Before running the application first install the following dependencies.

```python
  pip install pandas
  pip install sklearn
  pip install hvplot
```
*Assumption made for module challenge: the* **sys** *and Path module will not be required to be explicitely called out in Installation guide section*

To run Jupyter Lab, need to install Anaconda:
* [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) - an open-source distribution of the Python
